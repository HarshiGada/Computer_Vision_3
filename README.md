Determine and visualize HoG of image

The objective is to compute and visualize the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features of an image and analyze how parameter changes affect the results.

Resize the Image: Ensure that the given image is resized to dimensions that are multiples of 8.
Compute HoG Features: Use an 8×8 pixels per cell and 2×2 cells per block configuration to extract HoG features.
Visualize HoG Features: Generate and display the HoG feature visualization to understand the gradient orientation and magnitude.
Modify Parameters and Analyze Effects

Experiment with different parameter values, such as the number of pixels per cell and the number of cells per block.
Observe and document the changes in feature representation.
